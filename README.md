UnblockedWhere
==============

UnblockedWhere is a Chrome extension to enhance your YouTube experience. If a user visits a video that is blocked in their 
country, UnblockedWhere will provide a popup message suggesting four countries with easy-to-find proxies where the video
isn't blocked. It should be available in the Chrome store shortly. 

KNOWN ISSUES:
The extension usually gives two notifications instead of one, which is possibly due to how Chrome interprets a YouTube
video page's "loading" state.
