UnblockedWhere
==============

UnblockedWhere is a Chrome extension to enhance your YouTube experience. If a user visits a video that is blocked in their 
country, UnblockedWhere will provide a popup message suggesting four countries with easy-to-find proxies where the video
isn't blocked. The extension comes with its own version of jQuery to avoid Chrome's policy of only allowing URLs that have been explicitly whitelisted to be used in project files. UnblockedWhere is current available in the Chrome store. . 

KNOWN ISSUES:
The extension usually gives two notifications instead of one, which is possibly due to how Chrome interprets a YouTube
video page's "loading" state.
